In order to run the projects being developed, it is necessary to install
tensorflow. To install it, run the command:

pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.6.0-cp34-none-linux\_x86\_64.whl

The examples were developed using the cpu version. If the gpu version is
required, please look onto the official tensorflow documentation:
